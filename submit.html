          <p><strong>Submission &amp; Review Guidelines</strong></p>
          <p>Submissions to <em>Trace</em> should be uploaded to the appropriate repository on the Submittable website. General questions should be sent to the following e-mail address: trace [at] english [dot] ufl [dot] edu. Questions regarding specific issues of the journal should be directed to their respective editors (see the <em>Trace</em> submissions page).</p>
          <p>Traditional article submissions should be 3,000-6,000 words and should adhere to the most recent MLA citation guidelines. We accept the following attachment types: DOC, DOCX, or RTF. Media projects should be initially delivered as a URL, though they will ultimately be sent out for review in a zipped file. Please remove all authorial markers in submissions.</p>
          <p>After receiving your submission, Managing Editor(s) will confirm receipt and will notify you of our interest in your submission. Before publication, all accepted submissions will be blind peer reviewed, formatted, and copy-edited before publication. Published content will be listed under the &ldquo;Issues&rdquo; page of the journal. Submissions appearing in the latest issue of the journal will also appear on the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; page.</p>
          <p><strong>Review Process</strong><br /> <em>Trace </em>is a blind, peer-reviewed journal. The Managing Editor(s) review submissions and determine whether they will be assigned to reviewers. If the Managing Editor(s) determine that a submission does not fit within the scope of <em>Trace</em> or is otherwise unsuitable for blind review, they will notify the author(s) via e-mail. Once a submission has been reviewed by the Managing Editor(s), it is assigned and sent to two reviewers with specific guidelines. For more information about our reviewer guidelines, contact trace [at] english [dot] ufl [dot] edu.</p>
          <p>After examining reviewers&rsquo; responses, the Managing Editor(s) will determine which submissions are suitable for <em>Trace</em>. Contributors will be contacted about this decision and provided anonymous copies of each blind review.</p>
          <p>Author(s) will receive one of the following responses from Managing Editor(s):</p>
          <p>__<strong>Accept for Publication</strong>. Recommend publication with no serious qualifications; the selection requires only minor editorial revisions.</p>
          <p>__<strong>Revise and Resubmit</strong>. Recommend that the writer make substantial revisions to the submission and resubmit it for further review.</p>
          <p>__<strong>Decline Publication</strong>. The submission lacks in one or more ways, including relevance, readability, scholarly rigor, audience consideration and/or originality. The submission would require significant revisions to be considered for publication.</p>
          <p>Once the submission is resubmitted, it will be reviewed and copy-edited by <em>Trace </em>editors. Managing Editor(s) may request that authors of accepted submissions make necessary revisions and re-submit their work for final review.</p>
